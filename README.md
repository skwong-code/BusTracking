**Real Time Bus Tracking**

Hello! This is another learning project, and the objective is to learn how an API requests is used and implemented.

**Explanation**

The project assignment was by MIT XPro. This assignment practices fundamental JavaScript skills making use of:
•	API Requests

The API Request from 2 places.

Bus tracking is from Massachusetts Bay Transport Authority (MBTA)

**Future Improvements**

At the current its is only tracking the area of Massachusetts near MIT and other Universities.  I would need to add a legend for what the colors of the bus means and a time or some sort of reference to times and where the bus should arrive.
